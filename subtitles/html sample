Launched in 2017, Family Dinner works with local farmers and food purveyors weekly to find New England&#39;s best ingredients and deliver them to homes in the Greater Boston Area. They use data and predictive analytics to curate bountiful deliveries to their customers, reduce waste in the food supply chain and help small farmers be competitive at a larger scale.</p><p>Erin and the Family Dinner team are reimagining America&rsquo;s food system as a distributed network of small farms; prioritizing taste, quality, and food industry workers above growth, scale and corporate profit. Their mission is to build communities that celebrate great food and the people who grow it -- small farmers, purveyors and food industry workers.<br />&nbsp;<br />Prior to Family Dinner, Erin spent 11 years at MIT, most recently as the Assistant Director of MIT&rsquo;s Senseable City Lab where she incubated her passion for food, education, data and technology. The Lab uses a fusion of data science and design to understand the complex problems of cities around the world to make them greener, smarter and more equitable.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Erin lives in Massachusetts with her husband and Co-Founder Tim, and their toothless dog, Frank.</p>",

Launched in 2017, Family Dinner works with local farmers and food purveyors weekly to find New England&#39;s best ingredients and deliver them to homes in the Greater Boston Area. They use data and predictive analytics to curate bountiful deliveries to their customers, reduce waste in the food supply chain and help small farmers be competitive at a larger scale.</p><p>Erin and the Family Dinner team are reimagining America&rsquo;s food system as a distributed network of small farms; prioritizing taste, quality, and food industry workers above growth, scale and corporate profit. Their mission is to build communities that celebrate great food and the people who grow it -- small farmers, purveyors and food industry workers.<br />&nbsp;<br />Prior to Family Dinner, Erin spent 11 years at MIT, most recently as the Assistant Director of MIT&rsquo;s Senseable City Lab where she incubated her passion for food, education, data and technology. The Lab uses a fusion of data science and design to understand the complex problems of cities around the world to make them greener, smarter and more equitable.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Erin lives in Massachusetts with her husband and Co-Founder Tim, and their toothless dog, Frank.</p>",
